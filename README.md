# Interactive_SVG_Icons
Export each icon from Illustrator as an SVG. Use the SVGs as assets on the FIP/Brand Revival site (think icons for different flavours or ingredients). Add some simple interactivity with CSS and JavaScript. Use HTML (and the appropriate elements) to include a description of the icon set.
